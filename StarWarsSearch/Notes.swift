//Model Objects I will need:

//1) People
//2) Starships
//3) Vehicles
//4) Species
//5) Planets

//This means I need a baseURL, with a component for each object, and then the query term "search". I'll need to create five separate fetch functions, one for each type of search. So...five different controller files. Lol.

//I will need another view controller also, for the detail of a selected object.

//Delegates include: searchBarDelegate. POSSIBLY delegates for collectionView and tableView.
